              I am a passionate graphic and web designer with over 8 years of experience creating strong visual identities, intuitive user interfaces, and impactful digital experiences.
              What started as a creative passion in my childhood bedroom eight years ago has grown into a professional freelance career, which I have been running successfully for more than two years. Today, I help businesses, startups, and entrepreneurs build authentic and memorable brands through thoughtful design.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-10 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              I combine aesthetics with strategy and technical precision. From brand development and UI/UX design to pixel-perfect websites and high-quality print materials, I approach every project holistically — from concept to final execution.
              My goal is not just to create beautiful designs, but to deliver solutions that perform, engage, and drive real results. I value clear communication, reliability, and customized concepts tailored to each client’s needs.
              Driven by creativity, attention to detail, and a passion for innovation, I strive to create designs that stand out and leave a lasting impression.
